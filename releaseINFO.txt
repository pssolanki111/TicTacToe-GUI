The game is to be released soon for windows machines after implementation of some remaining features related to results and statistics.

The release will probably be a binary executable (.exe) wirh a package - everything bundled up as a zip file to reduce size of the distribution.

Details on how to downlosd and run the game will be added to this file as well as readme.md once the released is underway.
